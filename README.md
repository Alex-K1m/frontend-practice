A set of html templates that i make for practicing core web coding skills.

Currently i am doing [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. You can find my solutions at [my profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Alex-K1m). Feel free to leave a comment or give it a like.

### Directory structure

- `_fm-challenges/`: html templates
